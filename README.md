# Introduction

This repository contains code related to the [ICML 2019](https://icml.cc) paper, [Efficient Amortised Bayesian Inference for Hierarchical and Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12090). 

VI-HDS is a a flexible, scalable Bayesian inference framework for nonlinear dynamical systems characterised by distinct and hierarchical variability at the individual, group, and population levels. 
We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. 
We specify the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. 
This model class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed or “white-box” sub-components and neural network or “black-box” sub-components. 
Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation).

# Dependencies
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), a deep learning framework
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), numerical linear algebra for Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), data analysis and data structures
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), a parallel computing  framework. It's not essential, as the code can run (albeit, more slowly) in CPU mode.

# Running an example

1. Ensure the `src` directory is on your python path. Also, optionally, set the environment variables INFERENCE_DATA_DIR and INFERENCE_RESULTS_DIR to the directories to which data will be read and results will be written, and export it. By default, these are set to local paths "data" (built-in data files are stored here) and "results" (already in the .gitignore file) respectively.

    In Linux:
    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=.:src
    export INFERENCE_DATA_DIR=data
    export INFERENCE_RESULTS_DIR=results
    ```

    In Windows:
    ```dos
    set PYTHONPATH=.;src
    set INFERENCE_DATA_DIR=data
    set INFERENCE_RESULTS_DIR=results
    ```

2. Run the `dr_constant_icml` example by calling: 

    ```bash
    python src/run_xval.py --experiment=EXAMPLE specs/dr_constant_xval.yaml 
    ```

3. Run tensorboard to visualise the output. A folder will be created in your user-specified results directory with a name that combines the EXAMPLE name and a timestamp. E.g.

    `tensorboard --logdir=EXAMPLE_20181123T174132369485`

    TensorBoard uses port 6006 by default, so you can then visualise your example at http://localhost:6006. Alternatively, you can specify another port.

# Running tests

We make use of the [pytest](https://pytest.org/) library to run tests. 
    
In Windows:
```dos
set PYTHONPATH=.
pytest tests
```
